                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>This project focuses on the users who failed to pick-up their car. There are lots of variables on the process chain that can go wrong. User experience of rental offices is not that bright either. Since Carla works as a middleman, any problem that occur in the process makes Carla responsible in the eyes of the user.

                    <h5>Responsibility</h5>
                    <p>Carla is a small team and I was the only product 
                        designer at the moment. The scope of this project limited to the problems users could have after the pick-up for both Android and IOS platforms. 
                        Time was the limiting factor for this project because the amount of complains from the counter were rising due to rental office issues.

                    <p>I was dealing with a really dissatisfied and unhappy customer group who lost their way to commute all of a sudden. I needed to make the flow with minimum friction as possible, since their bounce back rate has the 
                        potential of being much higher than every step of the standard processes.

                    <h5>Forming the feature</h5>
                    <p>After the understand phase, we decided to create a feature that enables us to 
                        enlighten and offer solution to the problem at the counter right when it occurs.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>CX were falling short on immediate help, the customer needed to contact them from the support feature. Many of the users were not contacting even if they were not able to pick up to car.</li>
                        <li>We did not generate data automatically about the issues faced on the counter. We were not keeping track of them manually.</li>
                        <li> We wanted to collect sufficiant proof about the user not being able to pick up the car.</li> 
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Therefore we created a form that promts to users a little time after their pickup time, asking them if they were able to pick up the car.
                         Form included many options, that I collected from the interviews and existing data.
                        It also included PDF and picture upload sections to allow users to generate additional proof.

                <h5>Wireframes</h5>
                <p>Wireframe is one of the best ways to combine the 
                    information architecture and the visual elements. It saves
                    a lot of time by getting early feedback and seeing the problems early on.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since the information architecture is rather complex in this flow, I made two kinds of wireframe</li>
                        <li>First one was a low fidelity text based wireframe and the second one with high fidelity</li>
                        <li>I used Adobe XD for the wireframe and Adobe Photoshop for structure</li>
                        <li>I changed the architecture couple of times to optimize it </li>
                    </ul>

                <h5>UI design</h5>
                <p>Once I tested all the possible user flows and set up the architecture, I started designing the final screens in Sketch</p>
            <ul>
                <li> This feature is a little different from the Carla app’s usual style. I used subtle neomorphism to make the buttons more interesting since to increase compleation rate</li>
                <li>Since I designed this pages for both Android and iOS, I had to keep in mind of boths guidelines</li>

                <p>After the release of the feature, I analysed the user's interaction throught the process.
                    I have observed some patterns on some options and changed the information architecture accordingly to match the user behaviour.

                        <li>My biggest fear was emphasizing with the dissatisfied customer who thinks they are right. I overcome this by constantly analyzing scenarios.</li>
                        <li>My biggest struggle was the information structure because there was too much to process. This struggle solved itself when I worked them out one by one.</li>
                        <li>I learned that a little bit empathy goes a long way on improving user experince dramatically.</li>
                        <li>I experienced with information architecture.</li>
